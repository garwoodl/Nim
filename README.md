# Nim
A personal project to become more familiar with setting up my own workflows. I plan to implement a Nim backend and then build some bots on top of it using heuristic algorithms and reinforcement learning.

Edit: I found out during the project that Nim is a solved game. I implemented the winning strategy and so now there is a perfect bot that will play optimally on any board.
